#### Build this docker image

DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t stm32_dev -f .devcontainer/docker/Dockerfile .

#### Run container instance

docker run --rm -it stm32_dev

Recommended to use VSCode with `Dev Containers` installed.

#### Github Docker registry

See instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#pushing-container-images)

#### X11 Server (experimental)

Using JLink tools requires X11 Server installed on the host (it has pop-up window options)

This should be already installed on a Linux host.

For MacOS hosts you can install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
